## Installation
Currently, it is only possible to generate it by copying the files into the project.

## Usage
To utilize this project, you need to install the Inquirer package. Next, open the terminal from the root of the files and enter "node index.js," then respond to the questions. Once all questions are addressed, the README will be generated and you can further edit.
